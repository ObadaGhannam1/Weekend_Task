Once upon a time, a web developer named Alice struggled with the problem of her web projects behaving differently on different computers. Then, she discovered Docker, a magical tool that transformed her projects into portable containers. These containers ensured that her web applications worked consistently, no matter where she placed them, and made collaboration with other developers a breeze. With Docker's help, Alice's web development adventures became smoother and more enjoyable, and the days of It works on my machine were gone forever.
