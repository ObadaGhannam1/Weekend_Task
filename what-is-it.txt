Docker is a tool that helps developers create and manage containers. Containers are like packaged applications that include everything they need to run, making it easier to move and run software in different places.
Containers make it easier to build and deliver apps in cloud and hybrid environments. Docker, a popular tool, speeds up and simplifies containerization. Currently, Docker has more than 13 million users.
Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.
