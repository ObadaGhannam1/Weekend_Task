The Docker workflow includes different steps, such as coding the application, making a Dockerfile, generating the Docker image, and firing up the containers.
In order to properly understand the Docker work cycle, go through the below provided practical steps.
Step 1: Make a Program File

First, make a simple HTML file named “index.html” and copy the following code into the file:
Step 2: Make a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is like a set of instructions for turning your app into a Docker image. For a basic HTML program, create a file named Dockerfile and copy the provided instructions into it.
Step 3: Generate the Docker Image

Next, execute the “docker build” command to create a new Docker image from the newly created Dockerfile.
Step 4: Launch the Containers

To run your containerized program, use this command. It runs the container in the background (-d) and assigns an exposed port (-p).
